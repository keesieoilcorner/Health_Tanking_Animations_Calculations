To execute code, make sure you have Python version 3.9+
I also use MathTex to generate formulas which requires:
- Windows MiKTeX https://miktex.org or TeX Live https://www.tug.org/texlive
- macOS	Install MacTeX: brew install --cask mactex
- Linux	Install TeX Live: sudo apt-get install texlive-full

Make sure to run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' or install both manim and numpy via 'pip install manim numpy'
